Grails Debian Packager Plugin
=============

Debian Packager plugin allows generation of debian packages from a Grails 
application.

This plugin makes it easier to deploy grails applications on Debian 
based distros such as Ubuntu.

All this plugin does is to generate a .deb package that contains the files 
to be copied in the target host and a set of scripts that will be executed 
before/after the package is installed and another set of scripts that will
be run before/after the package is uninstalled.

For example, using this plugin one can create a package that depends on the 
installation of tomcat7 on the target host. Once installed this package can 
place the war file in the /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps directory, place some 
configuration files in /etc on the target host, and place some static html 
documents in /var/www/htdocs.

Via a preinst script, the package can ensure that a given group and user 
exist in the target host before the package is installed. 

Via a postinst script, the package can guarantee that some given paths exist 
by creating the needed symbolic links. Also, if needed the postinst script 
can start an arbitrary service after been installed.

And so on . . . 

Once the debian package is created, it's possible to make it available to an 
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/HowToSetupADebianRepository">apt-get repository</a> 
allowing system administrators to install/upgrade a grails web application by 
simply issuing a command like

<pre>
sudo apt-get install mycompany-mygrailsapp
</pre>

in the target host and allowing the use of <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">chef</a> 
or <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a> to quickly provision the application in 
a brand new computer.

Installation
-------

To install the latest stable version of the plugin run:

	grails install-plugin debian-packager

Build configuration
-------

The plugin reads the following grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy
configurations:

<dl>

	<dt>debian.name</dt>
	<dd>Name of debian package file. Defaults to ${appName}_${appVersion}</dd>
	
	<dt>debian.install.home</dt>
	<dd>Default instalation directory of package contents, defaults to /opt/${appName}</dd>
	
	<dt>debian.install.target.directory</dt>
	<dd>
	Directory where the war file generated with 'grails war' will be placed
	in the package. Defaults to ${debian.install.home}/webapps
	</dd>
	
	<dt>debian.install.war.name</dt>
	<dd>
	Name of the war file in the target directory. 
	Defaults to current war file. Useful for renaming the 
	generated war in the debian package.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>debian.install.user</dt>
	<dd>
	User that may be created during the debian package installation. 
	Defaults to ${appName}. 
	</dd>
	
	<dt>debian.install.group</dt>
	<dd>
	Group that may be created during the debian package installation. 
	Defaults to ${appName}. 
	</dd>
	
	<dt>debian.install.data</dt>
	<dd>
	List of data items that will be included in the package.
	These items can be directories, files or tar.gz archives.
	Each item is described by a map with the following configuration 
	keys:
		<dl>
			<dt>type</dt>
			<dd>Either of file, directory or archive.</dd>
			
			<dt>src</dt>
			<dd>Path to the item to be included in the package. 
			If the type is directory or archive, all the item's contents are copied to the package.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>target</dt>
			<dd>Destination directory to the item in the package. Defaults to ${debian.install.home}</dd>
			
			<dt>name</dt>
			<dd>Valid only for items with type == 'file'. 
			Useful for renaming items in the generated package. 
			Defaults to the current file name.
			</dd>
		</dl>
	</dd>
</dl>

The following example includes a directory, a file and an archive in the generated package

<pre>
debian.data = [
	[
		src: "a",
		target: "/opt/test-src",
		type: "directory"
	],
	[
		src: "b/application.properties",
		target: "/opt/test",
		type: "file",
		name: "x.properties"
	],
	[
		src: "b/archive.tar.gz",
		target: "/opt/test/exploded",
		type: "archive"
	]
]
</pre>

Control Files
-------

When the plugin is installed it creates a directory named debian
in the project. In this directory are placed the package control 
files:

<dl>

<dt>control</dt>
<dd>package descriptor, see: 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html">http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html</a> 
for its description.</dd>

<dt>preinst</dt>
<dd>commands to be executed before the package is installed</dd>

<dt>postinst</dt>
<dd>commands to be executed after the package is installed</dd>

<dt>prerm</dt>
<dd>commands to be executed before the package is removed</dd>

<dt>postrm</dt>
<dd>commands to be executed after the package is removed</dd>

<dt>conffiles</dt>
<dd>list of package configuration files, see: <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html#s-conffile">http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html#s-conffile</a> for further information.</dd>
</dl>

These files are actually Groovy SimpleTemplate templates (see: <a href="">http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Templates</a>)
that are processed before the generation of the package. The following values configured on BuildConfig.groovy are available to these templates:

<dl>

<dt>installHome (${debian.install.home}) </dt>
<dd>default instalation directory of package contents, defaults to /opt/${appName}</dd>

<dt>appName</dt>
<dd>name of grails application</dd>

<dt>appVersion</dt>
<dd>application version</dd>

<dt>user (${debian.install.user})</dt>
<dd>a user that may be created by this package, defaults to ${appName}</dd>

<dt>group (${debian.install.group})</dt>
<dd>a group that may be created by this package, defaults to ${appName}</dd>

</dl>

Packaging
-------

To generate the debian package, use the following command:

	grails debian
